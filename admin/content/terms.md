# Standard Terms and Conditions of Purchase—United States

### 1\. TERMS OF AGREEMENT

The purchase order, together with these terms and conditions, and any attachments and exhibits, specifications, drawings, notes, instructions, and other information, whether physically attached or incorporated by reference (collectively the “Purchase Order”), constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between The CBORD Group, Inc. (CBORD) and the supplier (the “Supplier”) identified in the Purchase Order. CBORD’s submission of the Purchase Order is conditioned on Supplier’s agreement that any terms different from or in addition to the terms of the Purchase Order, whether communicated orally or contained in any purchase order confirmation, invoice, acknowledgement, release, acceptance, or other written correspondence, irrespective of the timing, shall not form a part of the Purchase Order, even if Supplier purports to condition its acceptance of the Purchase Order on CBORD’s agreement to such different or additional terms. Supplier’s electronic acceptance, acknowledgement of this Purchase Order, or commencement of performance constitutes Supplier’s acceptance of these terms and conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a master agreement covering procurement of the Work described in the Purchase Order exists between Supplier and CBORD, the terms of such master agreement shall prevail over any inconsistent terms herein.

Supplier will immediately notify CBORD if Supplier’s timely performance under the Purchase Order is delayed or is likely to be delayed. CBORD’s acceptance of Supplier’s notice will not constitute CBORD’s waiver of any of Supplier’s obligations.

3.2 If Supplier delivers Work after the Delivery Date, CBORD may reject such Work.

3.3 CBORD will hold any Work rejected under this Purchase Order at Supplier’s risk and expense, including storage charges, while awaiting Supplier’s return shipping instructions. Supplier will bear all return shipping charges, including without limitation, insurance charges CBORD incurs on Supplier’s behalf. CBORD may, in its sole discretion, destroy or sell at a public or private sale any rejected Work for which CBORD  does not receive return shipping instructions within a reasonable time, and apply the proceeds, if any, first toward any storage charges.

3.4 Supplier will preserve, pack, package, and handle the Deliverables and Products so as to protect the Deliverables and Products from loss or damage and in accordance with best commercial practices in the absence of any specifications CBORD may provide. Without limiting the foregoing, Supplier shall observe the requirements of any local laws and regulations relating to hazardous work, including, without limitation, with respect to its accompanying information, packing, labeling, reporting, carriage, and disposal.

Supplier shall use its best efforts to assist CBORD in all legal efforts to minimize the taxes resulting from the performance of this Purchase Order.

4.2 CBORD will pay Supplier the price in accordance with the payment terms set forth in the Purchase Order following the later of:

(i) the Delivery Date;

A properly prepared invoice must include the Purchase Order number and, if required in the Purchase Order, Supplier’s certification of conformance of the Work to the requirements. Payment will be in the currency of the country in which the CBORD entity or affiliate identified in the Purchase Order is located, and if the price set forth in the Purchase Order is not in the local currency, then CBORD will determine the local currency equivalent of the price as of date of payment. CBORD may, at any time, set-off any amounts Supplier owes CBORD against any amounts CBORD owes to Supplier or any of its affiliated companies.

5.1 Unless otherwise specified in a SOW and except as provided in Section 5.2, CBORD is the sole and exclusive owner of all Deliverables and Supplier hereby irrevocably assigns and transfers to CBORD all of its worldwide right and title to, and interest in, the Deliverables, including all associated Intellectual Property Rights.

5.2 Unless otherwise specified in a SOW, each party owns all right, title, and interest in and to any of its Preexisting Materials. Supplier hereby grants CBORD a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, transferable, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, with the right to sublicense and authorize the granting of sublicenses, to use and reproduce Supplier’s Preexisting Materials in the Deliverables to the extent necessary for CBORD’s exercise and use of its rights in the Deliverables.

5.3 Unless otherwise specified in an SOW, Supplier will obtain and assign to CBORD a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable license to use all Third Party Intellectual Property Rights incorporated into, required to use, or delivered with the Work. Supplier will deliver copies of the above releases and licenses to CBORD upon CBORD’s request.

### 6\. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE

CBORD may reject any or all of the Work which does not conform to the applicable requirements within 10 business days of Supplier’s delivery of the Work. At CBORD’s option, CBORD may (i) return the nonconforming Work to Supplier for a refund or credit, (ii) require Supplier to replace the non-conforming Work, or (iii) repair the non-conforming Work so that it meets the requirements. As an alternative to (i) through (iii), CBORD may accept the non-conforming Work conditioned on Supplier providing a refund or credit in an amount CBORD reasonably determines to represent the diminished value of the non-conforming Work. CBORD’s payment to Supplier for Work prior to CBORD’s timely rejection of such Work as nonconforming will not be deemed as acceptance by CBORD.

### 7\. CHANGES

7.1 As used in this Section 7, “Change” means a change CBORD directs or causes within the general scope of this Agreement, the applicable SOW, or both.

7.2 CBORD, by written order (“Change Order”), may make Changes in accordance with this Section 7.

7.3 If Supplier asserts that CBORD has directed or caused a Change to the cost of or time for performance for which CBORD has not issued a Change Order, Supplier will promptly notify CBORD in writing of the Change, providing (i) a description of the action or inaction asserted to have caused the Change, (ii) an estimate of the equitable adjustment that would be required for Supplier to perform the Changed Work, and (iii) a date no less than 30 days from the date of notice by which CBORD must respond to Supplier’s notice so that Supplier may proceed with the Work unchanged. CBORD will evaluate Supplier’s notice of Change in good faith, and if CBORD agrees that it has made a constructive change, CBORD will issue a Change Order to Supplier.

7.4 Supplier shall, as promptly as practicable, after giving the notice of the Change, or within 10 days of receiving a Change Order, submit a request for equitable adjustment specifying the adjustment in the price or time for performance resulting from the Change.

7.5 The parties shall negotiate an amendment to the applicable SOW to incorporate a Change Order providing for an equitable adjustment to the price, time for performance, or both.

The Indemnified Party will have no authority to settle any Claim on the Indemnified Party’s behalf.

Supplier represents and warrants that it will comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations pertaining to its performance of its obligations under this Purchase Order.

The Purchase Order will be construed in accordance with, and all disputes will be governed by, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. The parties specifically waive application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
